- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bloxerk
- 👀 I’m interested in the fields of programming and coding in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, although I have learned to a lesser extent and intend to learn more about C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Lua and Powershell (is that even a language? probably not, right?).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on figuring out how to join the online github community of programmers/coders/whatever the heck you big bunch of nerds prefer to be called (advanced button pushers? idk)
- 📫 You can reach me on Gmail @ Julienbloxerk@gmail.com, although I make no promises to be responsive in any way, I try my hardest to pay attention to my email but it usually falls behind on my list of things to pay attention to.
Alternatively, you can reach me on discord @ Taxes#6340. I am very open to conversation on any topic for any reason and if you want to have a conversation longer than a few messages
about how i keep putting my questions in the wrong threads, Discord is where you will find me to be the most active.

I am extremely new to being in an online community of any kind outside of a tiny group of my friends on discord, and thus have no idea how to exist, nor do I understand how Github works.
pls b nice im new
